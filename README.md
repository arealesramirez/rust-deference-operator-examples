# Rust | Dereference Unary Operator Examples 
This simple repository shows the code snippets used in the article https://www.becomebetterprogrammer.com/rust-dereference-unix-operator/ to understand how the dereference unix operator works for all the different Rust pointers such as:
- Shared References (&)
- Mutable References (&mut)
- Raw pointers (*const and *mut)
- Smart Pointers

## Requirements
This example codebase uses Rust programming language. Hence, you must have Rust properly installed in your machine if you want to run the code.

Refer to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install to setup Rust in your local machine.

## Do you want to run the code?
Clone this repo to your local machine. Open the terminal and run the command `cargo run` command.
